# PDF Content Extractor 

This project is a tool designed to extract **text** and **images** from educational PDFs such as Olympiad sample papers, and generate a **structured JSON** output that organizes the content page-by-page for downstream use like question answering or dataset preparation.

---

##  Features

-  Extracts **clean text** from each page of a PDF (removes `\n`).
-  Extracts **all images** from each page and saves them locally.
-  Generates a structured `JSON` file with:
  - Page number
  - Full page text (in one line)
  - Paths to all extracted images
